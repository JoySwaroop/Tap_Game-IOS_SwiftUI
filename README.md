# Tap Game ðŸŽ® ðŸ‘ˆ


## What is this App All About

TapGame is a simple and engaging SwiftUI-based game designed to test your reflexes and observation skills. The app displays a sequence of images (such as an apple, dog, or egg) and challenges you to tap the image that matches the target word shown below. The game features three difficulty levelsâ€”Easy, Medium, and Hardâ€”which control the speed at which the images cycle. Your score increases each time you correctly tap the matching image. The game can be restarted at any time, and the difficulty can be adjusted when the game is not running.
## What I have learned

â€¢ SwiftUI State Management: Learned how to use @State   properties to manage game state, including score, difficulty, and UI updates.

â€¢ Timer Usage: Implemented a repeating timer to control the pace of image changes based on the selected difficulty.

â€¢ User Interaction: Handled tap gestures and user feedback through alerts and conditional UI elements.

â€¢ Enums and Structs: Utilized enums to represent difficulty levels and manage related logic cleanly.

â€¢ Dynamic UI Updates: Updated the UI reactively based on game state changes, such as showing/hiding menus and buttons.
